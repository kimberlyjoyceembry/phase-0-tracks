# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control tracks any and all modifications made to files so that previous versions can easily be found.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a no fuss changeable pointer that directs you to information stored in a specific commit.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit sends and saves any changes, and the author and time line of these changes, made to files into the local repository. A good commit message should clearly explain what was changed.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict occurs when at least two people working on the same repository make changes on the same line.
