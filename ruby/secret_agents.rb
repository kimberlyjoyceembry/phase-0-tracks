# Driver code / calling our methods
#puts encrypt("abc") #should return "bcd"
#puts encrypt("zed") #should return "afe"
#puts decrypt("bcd") #should retun "abc"
#puts decrypt ("afe") #should return "zed"
#puts decrypt(encrypt("swordfish"))

#NOTES
# Using the nesting method, will decrpyt and encrpyt swordfish. The console prints out both results. 
# The result when it is encrypted and the result when it is decrpyted. 

#Adding an Interface

#Ask them for the password
puts "What is the password?"
password = gets.chomp


#Ask user whether they would to decrpt or encrypt a password
puts "Would you like to encrypt or decrypt a password?"
encrypt_decrypt = gets.chomp
	if encrypt_decrypt == "encrypt"
		encrypt_pass = encrypt_method("#{password}")
		puts "Your encrypted password is #{encrypt_pass}"
	elsif encrypt_decrypt == "decrypt"
		decrypt_pass = decrypt_method("#{password}")
		puts "Your decrypted password is #{decrypt_pass}"
	else
		puts "We didn't get that. You must be a spy! Goodbye!"
	end


#NOTES ABOUT INTERFACE
#values of the diff methods must match in order for the interface to be applied correctly. Had to change the value to "string" for both encrypt_method and decrypt_method
