<!-- 
	1. What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
	- Tags are used to describe what elements are being used to a developer and the browser (the section between the body tags). The most useful for myself are the ones used to organize, such as <nav> or <section>.
	2. What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
	- There needs to be a section tag, a header tag, and lastly the content.
	3. What did you learn about Sublime in this challege? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
	- I never knew you could create your own shortcuts/snippets. I do believe I'll utilize this tool in the future so I won't have to constantly look up code that I need to use.
	4. What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
	- I'd say it was difficult for me to understand the differences structurally needed between an aside or an article, and fully comprehending their uses. I think with more practice and exposure, I should be able to better understand these concepts.
