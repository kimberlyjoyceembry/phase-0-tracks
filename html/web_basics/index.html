	<h1>Obie, My Rosy Boa</h1>
	<p>I've always wanted a pet, but I also seem to have commmitment issues. So that ruled out anything fluffy and cute that required more attention than I am willing to provide. I still wanted something I could hold or play with or observe, so, no fish! Mini animals of fluffy nature also don't appeal to me. I've seen far too many die, and am pretty sure those childhood experiences have turned me off to the little critters. But, snakes? The long <strong>beautiful</strong> creatures that inspired fear in the majority of people in my life? Count me in! I mean, I've always been one to appreciate the misunderstood.</p>

	<p>So why a snake? Well here are a few reasons:
	<ul>
		<li>He's beautiful, duh</li>
		<li>He doesn't smell</li>
		<li>He can be left alone for a couple of days, no issue</li>
		<li>He poops like once a week</li>
	</ul></p>

	<p>Obie, Oberyn Rose, also scares the living poop out of me sometimes. Why you ask? For these three reasons:
	<ol>
		<li>He could bite me</li>
		<li>He could choke me</li>
		<li>He could escape while I'm sleeping and do either of the above</li>
	</p>

	<p>I gotta admit though, the danger <em>excites</em> me.</p>

	<p>I mean, look at <a href="http://imgur.com/a/4hqA2">him</a>, isn't he a beaut?</p>
